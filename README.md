# Algorithm design and problem solving

I try to write down about what I know or learn algorithms. Usually I keep them in my blog, but this time I try to write down in Github that
I can quickly to read the link and look at source code.

One day I was inspired from Department of Computer Science, Princeton University, Dr. Kevin Wayne. His lecture notes are [here](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wayne/kleinberg-tardos/).

First we need to define what is Algorithm Design and what they try to help. [see: **Algorithm design** ] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm_design)
