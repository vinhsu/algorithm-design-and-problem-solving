# Algorithm design and problem solving

I try to write down about what I know or learn algorithms. Usully I keep them in my blog, but this time I try to write down in Github that
I can quickly to read the link and look at source code.

One day I was inspired from Department of Computer Science, Princeton University, Dr. Kevin Wayne. His lecture notes are [here](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wayne/kleinberg-tardos/).

First we need to define what is Algorithm Design and what they try to help. [see: **Algorithm design** ] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm_design)

Great books to read:  
[Algorithm Design by Jon Kleinberg ](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Jon-Kleinberg/dp/0321295358)
[The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven S Skiena  ](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1457570078&sr=1-1&keywords=algorithm+design+manual)

Now let's start our journey.

Let's check what [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem) says.
